About MicroMVC
==============

MicroMVC is a simplistic framework integrated with [eventlet](http://eventlet.net) 
and [Cheetah](http://cheetahtemplate.org) for writing quick web applications in
Python. It's partially modeled after ASP.NET MVC in the terminology and structure
of a given web application, but that's where the similarities end.
